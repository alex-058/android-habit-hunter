## Welcome to the world of habits!

Building solid and everlasting habits is a difficult undertaking. 
But the solution is not far away. 

My app HabitHunter will help to first of all create habits, then insert progress on each habit and the app
automatically reset their progress daily, weekly or monthly. 

## Core Feature Overview

* Adding, Editing (Swipe-to-edit) and Deleting (Swipe-to-delete) habits 
* Image support for each habit
* Firebase Authentication with email / password
* Firebase Realtime Database as Backend component for habits (Firebase DB)
* Firebase cloud storage for storing images (Firebase CS)
* Resetting habit progress in given time period via alarm manager implementation and callback
* Huge commit history with feature branches and tagged releases in master branch
* Bottom navigation for flat and concise UX  
* MVVM pattern implemented with live data and view models
* Custom circular progress bar to track habit progress for enhanced user experience
* Data binding (one and two way) in views
