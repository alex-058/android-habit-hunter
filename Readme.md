# Habit Hunter

## Welcome to the world of habits!

This is my assignment for the Advanced App Programming course with Kotlin lectured by Dave Drohan. 
Building solid and everlasting habits is a difficult undertaking. 
But the solution is not far away. 

My app HabitHunter will help to first of all create habits, then insert progress on each habit and the app
automatically reset their progress daily, weekly or monthly. 

To get a better understanding, not only about all the features, but from a more technical perspective 
the technical report for my assignment will follow here

## Core Feature Overview

* Adding, Editing (Swipe-to-edit) and Deleting (Swipe-to-delete) habits 
* Image support for each habit
* Firebase Authentication with email / password
* Firebase Realtime Database as Backend component for habits (Firebase DB)

* Resetting habit progress in given time period via alarm manager implementation and callback
